	abstract = {In the emission spectrum of the nitric oxide molecule 13 bands of the γ system (A2Σ+–X2Π) were recorded and analyzed. The following bands of this system comprising over 3950 lines were photographed under high resolution by using conventional spectroscopy and Th standard lines: 0–0 through 0–6 and 1–4, 1–5, 2–0, 2–6, 2–7, and 3–4. The analysis of the individual bands and the merged analysis of the entire band system made it possible to unify, extend, and improve the information about the γ system and the energy structure of its participating statesA2Σ+andX2Π. RKR turning points of theAandXstates and Franck–Condon factors andrcentroids for theA–Xsystem were also determined using the precise molecular parameters obtained in the present work.}
