	abstract = {In the emission spectrum of the nitric oxide molecule 13 bands of the γ system (A2Σ+–X2Π) were recorded and analyzed. The following bands of this system comprising over 3950 lines were photographed under high resolution by using conventional spectroscopy and Th standard lines: 0–0 through 0–6 and 1–4, 1–5, 2–0, 2–6, 2–7, and 3–4. The analysis of the individual bands and the merged analysis of the entire band system made it possible to unify, extend, and improve the information about the γ system and the energy structure of its participating statesA2Σ+andX2Π. RKR turning points of theAandXstates and Franck–Condon factors andrcentroids for theA–Xsystem were also determined using the precise molecular parameters obtained in the present work.}

	abstract = "{The NO2 photodissociation threshold has been observed by laser induced fluorescence in a jet at 25 128.57±0.05 cm−1. The unexpected high vibronic level density of 2.7 levels/cm−1 is tentatively attributed to long range interactions between the NO (2Π1/2) and O(3P2) products. The energy spacing and intensity distributions indicate rovibronic chaos.}",

	abstract = {The pgopher program is a general purpose program for simulating and fitting molecular spectra, particularly the rotational structure. The current version can handle linear molecules, symmetric tops and asymmetric tops and many possible transitions, both allowed and forbidden, including multiphoton and Raman spectra in addition to the common electric dipole absorptions. Many different interactions can be included in the calculation, including those arising from electron and nuclear spin, and external electric and magnetic fields. Multiple states and interactions between them can also be accounted for, limited only by available memory. Fitting of experimental data can be to line positions (in many common formats), intensities or band contours and the parameters determined can be level populations as well as rotational constants. pgopher is provided with a powerful and flexible graphical user interface to simplify many of the tasks required in simulating, understanding and fitting molecular spectra, including Fortrat diagrams and energy level plots in addition to overlaying experimental and simulated spectra. The program is open source, and can be compiled with open source tools. This paper provides a formal description of the operation of version 9.1.}
